# cyclone-physics  
This project is a repository forked from [here](https://github.com/idmillington/cyclone-physics).  
However, the latest version of this repository is vs2010.  
Due to various bugs related to compatibility, I was unable to test this project.  
Therefore, I wrapped the project myself in vs2022 version.
